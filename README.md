This repository contains examples of uncommon errors in Python such as OverflowError and RecursionError. The code demonstrates how these errors can occur and provides solutions on how to handle them using try-except blocks and the decimal module for arbitrary-precision arithmetic.  The OverflowError occurs when an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum representable value for an integer type, and RecursionError is caused by exceeding the maximum recursion depth.  The examples show how to prevent or gracefully handle these situations.
